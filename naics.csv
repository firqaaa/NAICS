"Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting","The Sector as a Whole   The Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in growing  crops, raising animals, harvesting timber, and harvesting fish and other animals from a farm, ranch, or their natural  habitats.   The establishments in this sector are often described as farms, ranches, dairies, greenhouses, nurseries, orchards,  or hatcheries. A farm may consist of a single tract of land or a number of separate tracts which may be held under  different tenures. For example, one tract may be owned by the farm operator and another rented. It may be operated  by the operator alone or with the assistance of members of the household or hired employees, or it may be operated  by a partnership, corporation, or other type of organization. When a landowner has one or more tenants, renters,  croppers, or managers, the land operated by each is considered a farm.   The sector distinguishes two basic activities: agricultural production and agricultural support activities.  Agricultural production includes establishments performing the complete farm or ranch operation, such as farm  owner-operators and tenant farm operators. Agricultural support activities include establishments that perform one  or more activities associated with farm operation, such as soil preparation, planting, harvesting, and management, on  a contract or fee basis.   Excluded from the Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting sector are establishments primarily engaged in  agricultural research (e.g., experimental farms) and government establishments primarily engaged in administering  programs for regulating and conserving land, mineral, wildlife, and forest use. These establishments are classified  in Industry 54171, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences; and Industry 92412,  Administration of Conservation Programs, respectively. "
Crop Production," Industries in the Crop Production subsector grow crops mainly for food and fiber. The subsector comprises  establishments, such as farms, orchards, groves, greenhouses, and nurseries, primarily engaged in growing crops,  plants, vines, or trees and their seeds.   The industries in this subsector are grouped by similarity of production activity, including biological and  physiological characteristics and economic requirements, the length of growing season, degree of crop rotation,  extent of input specialization, labor requirements, and capital demands. The production process is typically  completed when the raw product or commodity grown reaches the ""farm gate"" for market, that is, at the point of first  sale or price determination.   Establishments are classified in the Crop Production subsector when crop production (i.e., value of crops for  market) accounts for one-half or more of the establishment's total agricultural production. Within the subsector,  establishments are classified in a specific industry when a product or industry family of products (i.e., oilseed and  grain farming, vegetable and melon farming, fruit and tree nut farming) account for one-half or more of the  establishment's agricultural production. Establishments with one-half or more crop production with no one product  or family of products of an industry accounting for one-half of the establishment's agricultural production are treated  as general combination crop farming and are classified in Industry 11199, All Other Crop Farming.   Industries in the Crop Production subsector include establishments that own, operate, and manage and those that  operate and manage. Those that manage only are classified in Subsector 115, Support Activities for Agriculture and  Forestry. Establishments that raise aquatic plants in controlled or selected aquatic environments are classified in  Subsector 112, Animal Production and Aquaculture. "

"
Forestry and Logging," Industries in the Forestry and Logging subsector grow and harvest timber on a long production cycle (i.e., of 10  years or more). Long production cycles use different production processes than short production cycles, which  require more horticultural interventions prior to harvest, resulting in processes more similar to those found in the  Crop Production subsector. Consequently, Christmas tree production and other production involving production  cycles of less than 10 years, are classified in the Crop Production subsector.   Industries in this subsector specialize in different stages of the production cycle. Reforestation requires production  of seedlings in specialized nurseries. Timber production requires natural forest or suitable areas of land that are  available for a long duration. The maturation time for timber depends upon the species of tree, the climatic  conditions of the region, and the intended purpose of the timber. The harvesting of timber (except when done on an  extremely small scale) requires specialized machinery unique to the industry. Establishments gathering forest  products, such as gums, barks, balsam needles, rhizomes, fibers, Spanish moss, and ginseng and truffles, are also  included in this subsector. "

"Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction","The Sector as a Whole   The Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction sector comprises establishments that extract naturally  occurring mineral solids, such as coal and ores; liquid minerals, such as crude petroleum; and gases, such as natural  gas. The term ""mining"" is used in the broad sense to include quarrying, well operations, beneficiating (e.g.,  crushing, screening, washing, and flotation), and other preparation customarily performed at the mine site, or as a  part of mining activity.   The Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction sector distinguishes two basic activities: mine operation and  mining support activities. Mine operation includes establishments operating mines, quarries, or oil and gas wells on  their own account or for others on a contract or fee basis. Mining support activities include establishments that  perform exploration (except geophysical surveying and mapping) on a contract or fee basis and/or other mining  services on a contract or fee basis (except mine site preparation, construction, and transportation activities).   Establishments in the Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction sector are grouped and classified according  to the natural resource mined or to be mined. Industries include establishments that develop and/or operate the mine  site, extract the natural resources, beneficiate (i.e., prepare) the mineral mined, or provide mining support activities.  Beneficiation is the process whereby the extracted material is reduced to particles that can be separated into mineral  and waste, the former suitable for further processing or direct use. The operations that take place in beneficiation  are primarily mechanical, such as grinding, washing, magnetic separation, and centrifugal separation. In contrast,  manufacturing operations primarily use chemical and electrochemical processes, such as electrolysis and distillation.  However, some treatments, such as heat treatments, take place in both the beneficiation and the manufacturing (i.e.,  smelting/refining) stages. The range of preparation activities varies by mineral and the purity of any given ore  deposit. While some minerals, such as petroleum and natural gas, require little or no preparation, others are washed  and screened, while yet others, such as gold and silver, can be transformed into bullion before leaving the mine site.   Mining, beneficiating, and manufacturing activities often occur in a single location. Separate receipts will be  collected for these activities whenever possible. When receipts cannot be broken out between mining and  manufacturing, establishments that mine or quarry nonmetallic minerals, and then beneficiate the nonmetallic  minerals into more finished manufactured products are classified based on the primary activity of the establishment.  A mine that manufactures a small amount of finished products will be classified in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying,  and Oil and Gas Extraction. An establishment that mines whose primary output is a more finished manufactured  product will be classified in Sector 31-33, Manufacturing. "
Oil and Gas Extraction," Industries in the Oil and Gas Extraction subsector operate and/or develop oil and gas field properties. Operation  and development activities include exploration for crude petroleum and natural gas; drilling, completing, and  equipping wells; operating separators, emulsion breakers, desilting equipment, and field gathering lines for crude  petroleum and natural gas; and all other activities in the preparation of oil and gas up to the point of shipment from  the producing property. This subsector includes the production of crude petroleum, the mining and extraction of oil  from oil shale and oil sands, the production of natural gas, sulfur recovery from natural gas, and recovery of  hydrocarbon liquids.   Establishments in this subsector include those that operate oil and gas wells on their own account or for others on a  contract or fee basis. Establishments primarily engaged in providing support services, on a contract or fee basis,  required for the drilling or operation of oil and gas wells (except geophysical surveying and mapping, mine site  preparation, construction of oil/gas pipelines, and transportation activities) are classified in Subsector 213, Support  Activities for Mining.

Construction,"The Sector as a Whole   The Construction sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in the construction of buildings or  engineering projects (e.g., highways and utility systems). Establishments primarily engaged in the preparation of  sites for new construction and establishments primarily engaged in subdividing land for sale as building sites also  are included in this sector.   Construction work done may include new work, additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs. Activities of  these establishments generally are managed at a fixed place of business, but they usually perform construction  activities at multiple project sites. Production responsibilities for establishments in this sector are usually specified  in (1) contracts with the owners of construction projects (prime contracts) or (2) contracts with other construction  establishments (subcontracts).   Establishments primarily engaged in contracts that include responsibility for all aspects of individual construction  projects are commonly known as general contractors, but also may be known as design-builders, construction  managers, turnkey contractors, or (in cases where two or more establishments jointly secure a general contract)  joint-venture contractors. Construction managers that provide oversight and scheduling only (i.e., agency) as well as  construction managers that are responsible for the entire project (i.e., at risk) are included as general contractor type  establishments. Establishments of the ""general contractor type"" frequently arrange construction of separate parts of  their projects through subcontracts with other construction establishments.   Establishments primarily engaged in activities to produce a specific component (e.g., masonry, painting, and  electrical work) of a construction project are commonly known as specialty trade contractors. Activities of specialty  trade contractors are usually subcontracted from other construction establishments, but especially in remodeling and  repair construction, the work may be done directly for the owner of the property.   Establishments primarily engaged in activities to construct buildings to be sold on sites that they own are known as  for-sale builders, but also may be known as speculative builders or merchant builders. For-sale builders produce  buildings in a manner similar to general contractors, but their production processes also include site acquisition and  securing of financial backing. For-sale builders are most often associated with the construction of residential  buildings. Like general contractors, they may subcontract all or part of the actual construction work on their  buildings.   There are substantial differences in the types of equipment, work force skills, and other inputs required by  establishments in this sector. To highlight these differences and variations in the underlying production functions,  this sector is divided into three subsectors.   Subsector 236, Construction of Buildings, comprises establishments of the general contractor type and for-sale  builders involved in the construction of buildings. Subsector 237, Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction,  comprises establishments involved in the construction of engineering projects. Subsector 238, Specialty Trade  Contractors, comprises establishments engaged in specialty trade activities generally needed in the construction of  all types of buildings.   Force account construction is construction work performed by an enterprise primarily engaged in some business  other than construction for its own account, using employees of the enterprise. This activity is not included in the  construction sector unless the construction work performed is the primary activity of a separate establishment of the  enterprise. The installation and the ongoing repair and maintenance of telecommunications and utility networks is  excluded from construction when the establishments performing the work are not independent contractors.  Although a growing proportion of this work is subcontracted to independent contractors in the Construction sector,  the operating units of telecommunications and utility companies performing this work are included with the  telecommunications or utility activities. "
Construction of Buildings," The Construction of Buildings subsector comprises establishments primarily responsible for the construction of  buildings. The work performed may include new work, additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs. The on- site assembly of precut, panelized, and prefabricated buildings and construction of temporary buildings are included  in this subsector. Part or all of the production work for which the establishments in this subsector have  responsibility may be subcontracted to other construction establishments--usually specialty trade contractors.  TÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  Establishments in this subsector are classified based on the types of buildings they construct. This classification  reflects variations in the requirements of the underlying production processes. "

Specialty Trade Contractors," The Specialty Trade Contractors subsector comprises establishments whose primary activity is performing specific  activities (e.g., pouring concrete, site preparation, plumbing, painting, and electrical work) involved in building  construction or other activities that are similar for all types of construction, but that are not responsible for the entire  project. The work performed may include new work, additions, alterations, maintenance, and repairs. The  production work performed by establishments in this subsector is usually subcontracted from establishments of the  general contractor type or for-sale builders, but especially in remodeling and repair construction, work also may be  done directly for the owner of the property. Specialty trade contractors usually perform most of their work at the  construction site, although they may have shops where they perform prefabrication and other work. Establishments  primarily engaged in preparing sites for new construction are also included in this subsector.   There are substantial differences in types of equipment, work force skills, and other inputs required by specialty  trade contractors. Establishments in this subsector are classified based on the underlying production function for the  specialty trade in which they specialize. Throughout the Specialty Trade Contractors subsector, establishments  commonly provide both the parts and labor required to complete work. For example, electrical contractors supply  the current-carrying and noncurrent-carrying wiring devices that are required to install a circuit. Plumbing, heating,  and air-conditioning contractors also supply the parts required to complete a contract.   Establishments that specialize in activities primarily related to heavy and civil engineering construction that are  not normally performed on buildings, such as the painting of lines on highways, are classified in Subsector 237,  Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction.

Wood Kitchen Cabinet and Countertop Manufacturing," Industries in the Furniture and Related Product Manufacturing subsector make furniture and related articles, such  as mattresses, window blinds, cabinets, and fixtures. The processes used in the manufacture of furniture include the  cutting, bending, molding, laminating, and assembly of such materials as wood, metal, glass, plastics, and rattan.  However, the production process for furniture is not solely bending metal, cutting and shaping wood, or extruding  and molding plastics. Design and fashion trends play an important part in the production of furniture. The  integrated design of the article for both esthetic and functional qualities is also a major part of the process of  manufacturing furniture. Design services may be performed by the furniture establishment's work force or may be  purchased from industrial designers.   Furniture may be made of any material, but the most common ones used in North America are metal and wood.  Furniture manufacturing establishments may specialize in making articles primarily from one material. Some of the  equipment required to make a wooden table, for example, is different from that used to make a metal one. However,  furniture is usually made from several materials. A wooden table might have metal brackets, and a wooden chair a  fabric or plastics seat. Therefore, in NAICS, furniture initially is classified based on the type of furniture  (application for which it is designed) rather than the material used. For example, an upholstered sofa is treated as  household furniture, although it may also be used in hotels or offices.   When classifying furniture according to the component material from which it is made, furniture made from more  than one material is classified based on the material used in the frame, or if there is no frame, the predominant  component material. Upholstered household furniture (excluding kitchen and dining room chairs with upholstered  seats) is classified without regard to the frame material. Kitchen or dining room chairs with upholstered seats are  classified according to the frame material.   Furniture may be made on a stock or custom basis and may be shipped assembled or unassembled (i.e.,  knockdown). The manufacture of furniture parts and frames is included in this subsector.   Some of the processes used in furniture manufacturing are similar to processes that are used in other segments of  manufacturing. For example, cutting and assembly occurs in the production of wood trusses that are classified in  Subsector 321, Wood Product Manufacturing. However, the multiple processes that distinguish wood furniture  manufacturing from wood product manufacturing warrant inclusion of wooden furniture manufacturing in the  Furniture and Related Product Manufacturing subsector. Metal furniture manufacturing uses techniques that are also  employed in the manufacturing of roll formed products classified in Subsector 332, Fabricated Metal Product  Manufacturing. The molding process for plastics furniture is similar to the molding of other plastics products.  However, plastics furniture producing establishments tend to specialize in furniture.   NAICS attempts to keep furniture manufacturing together, but there are notable exceptions: concrete, ceramic, or  stone furniture; seating for transportation equipment; and specialized hospital furniture (e.g., hospital beds and  operating tables). These are classified in Subsector 327, Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing; Subsector  336, Transportation Equipment Manufacturing; and Subsector 339, Miscellaneous Manufacturing, respectively.  3371 Household and Institutional Furniture and Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturing  This industry group comprises establishments manufacturing household-type furniture, such as living room,  kitchen and bedroom furniture and institutional (i.e., public building) furniture, such as furniture for schools,  theaters, and churches.

Manufacturing,"The Sector as a Whole   The Manufacturing sector comprises establishments engaged in the mechanical, physical, or chemical  transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products. The assembling of component parts of  manufactured products is considered manufacturing, except in cases where the activity is appropriately classified in  Sector 23, Construction.   Establishments in the Manufacturing sector are often described as plants, factories, or mills and characteristically  use power-driven machines and material handling equipment. However, establishments that transform materials or  substances into new products by hand or in the worker's home and those engaged in selling to the general public  products made on the same premises from which they are sold, such as bakeries, candy stores, and custom tailors,  may also be included in this sector. Manufacturing establishments may process materials or may contract with other  establishments to process their materials for them. Both types of establishments are included in manufacturing.  Selected industries in the Manufacturing sector are comprised solely of establishments that process materials for  other establishments on a contract or fee basis. Beyond these dedicated contract manufacturing industries,  establishments that process materials for other establishments are generally classified in the Manufacturing industry  of the processed materials.   The materials, substances, or components transformed by manufacturing establishments are raw materials that are  products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining, or quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing  establishments. The materials used may be purchased directly from producers, obtained through customary trade  channels, or secured without recourse to the market by transferring the product from one establishment to another,  under the same ownership.   The new product of a manufacturing establishment may be finished in the sense that it is ready for utilization or  consumption, or it may be semi-finished to become an input for an establishment engaged in further manufacturing.  For example, the product of the alumina refinery is the input used in the primary production of aluminum; primary  aluminum is the input to an aluminum wire drawing plant; and aluminum wire is the input for a fabricated wire  product manufacturing establishment.   The subsectors in the Manufacturing sector generally reflect distinct production processes related to material  inputs, production equipment, and employee skills. In the machinery area, where assembling is a key activity, parts  and accessories for manufactured products are classified in the industry of the finished manufactured item when they  are made for separate sale. For example, an attachment for a piece of metalworking machinery would be classified  with metalworking machinery. However, component inputs from other manufacturing establishments are classified  based on the production function of the component manufacturer. For example, electronic components are classified  in Subsector 334, Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing, and stampings are classified in Subsector 332,  Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing.   Manufacturing establishments often perform one or more activities that are classified outside the Manufacturing  sector of NAICS. For instance, almost all manufacturing has some captive research and development or  administrative operations, such as accounting, payroll, or management. These captive services are treated the same  as captive manufacturing activities. When the services are provided by separate establishments, they are classified  in the NAICS sector where such services are primary, not in manufacturing.   The boundaries of manufacturing and the other sectors of the classification system can be somewhat blurry. The  establishments in the Manufacturing sector are engaged in the transformation of materials into new products. Their  output is a new product. However, the definition of what constitutes a new product can be somewhat subjective.

Beverage Manufacturing," Industries in the Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing subsector manufacture beverages and tobacco  products. The Beverage Manufacturing industry group includes three types of establishments: (1) those that  manufacture nonalcoholic beverages; (2) those that manufacture alcoholic beverages through the fermentation  process; and (3) those that produce distilled alcoholic beverages. Ice manufacturing, while not a beverage, is  included with nonalcoholic beverage manufacturing because it uses the same production process as water  purification.   In the case of activities related to the manufacture of beverages, the structure follows the defined production  processes. Brandy, a distilled beverage, is not placed under distillery product manufacturing, but rather under  winery product manufacturing since the production process used in the manufacturing of alcoholic grape-based  beverages produces both wines (fermented beverage) and brandies (distilled beverage).

Textile Mills,"Industries in the Textile Mills subsector group establishments that transform a basic fiber (natural or synthetic) into a product, such as yarn or fabric that is further manufactured into usable items, such as apparel, sheets, towels, and textile bags for individual or industrial consumption. The further manufacturing may be performed in the same establishment and classified in this subsector, or it may be performed at a separate establishment and be classified elsewhere in the Manufacturing sector.
The main processes in this subsector include preparation and spinning of fiber, knitting or weaving of fabric, and the finishing of the textile. The NAICS structure follows and captures this process flow.

"
Paper Manufacturing," Industries in the Paper Manufacturing subsector make pulp, paper, or converted paper products. The  manufacturing of these products is grouped together because they constitute a series of vertically connected  processes. More than one is often carried out in a single establishment. There are essentially three activities. The  manufacturing of pulp involves separating the cellulose fibers from other impurities in wood or used paper. The  manufacturing of paper involves matting these fibers into a sheet. The manufacturing of converted paper products  involves converting paper and other materials by various cutting and shaping techniques and includes coating and  laminating activities.   The Paper Manufacturing subsector is subdivided into two industry groups, the first for the manufacturing of pulp  and paper and the second for the manufacturing of converted paper products. Paper making is treated as the core  activity of the subsector. Therefore, any establishment that makes paper (including paperboard), either alone or in  combination with pulp manufacturing or paper converting, is classified as a paper or paperboard mill.  Establishments that make pulp without making paper are classified as pulp mills. Pulp mills, paper mills, and  paperboard mills comprise the first industry group.   Establishments that make products from purchased paper and other materials make up the second industry group,  Converted Paper Product Manufacturing. This general activity is then subdivided based, for the most part, on  process distinctions. Paperboard container manufacturing uses corrugating, cutting, and shaping machinery to form  paperboard into containers. Paper bag and coated and treated paper manufacturing establishments cut and coat  paper and foil. Stationery product manufacturing establishments make a variety of paper products used for writing,  filing, and similar applications. Other converted paper product manufacturing includes, in particular, the conversion  of sanitary paper stock into such things as tissue paper and disposable diapers.   An important process used in the Paper Bag and Coated and Treated Paper Manufacturing industry is lamination,  often combined with coating. Lamination and coating make a composite material with improved properties of  strength, impermeability, and so on. The laminated materials may be paper, metal foil, or plastics film. While paper  is often one of the components, it is not always. Lamination of plastics film to plastics film is classified in Subsector  326, Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing, because establishments that do this often first make the film. The  same situation holds with respect to bags. The manufacturing of bags from plastics only, whether or not laminated,  is classified in Subsector 326, Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing.   Excluded from this subsector are photosensitive papers. These papers are chemically treated and are classified in  Industry 32599, All Other Chemical Product and Preparation Manufacturing. "

The support activities included here are an integral part of the printing industry, and a product (a printing plate, a bound book, or a computer disk or file) that is an integral part of the printing industry is almost always provided by these operations.
Processes used in printing include a variety of methods used to transfer an image from a plate, screen, film, or computer file to some medium, such as paper, plastics, metal, textile articles, or wood. The printing processes employed include, but are not limited to, lithographic, gravure, screen, flexographic, digital, and letterpress.
In contrast to many other classification systems that locate publishing of printed materials in manufacturing, NAICS classifies the publishing of printed products in Subsector 513, Publishing Industries. Though printing and publishing are often carried out by the same enterprise, it is less and less the case that these distinct activities are carried out in the same establishment. When publishing and printing are done in the same establishment, the establishment is classified in Subsector 513, Publishing Industries, in the appropriate NAICS industry even if the receipts for printing exceed those for publishing.
This subsector includes printing on clothing because the production process for that activity is printing, not clothing manufacturing. For instance, the printing of T-shirts is included in this subsector. In contrast, printing on fabric (or grey goods) is not included. This activity is part of the process of finishing the fabric and is included in Industry 31331, Textile and Fabric Finishing Mills.

Chemical Manufacturing," The Chemical Manufacturing subsector is based on the transformation of organic and inorganic raw materials by a  chemical process and the formulation of products. This subsector distinguishes the production of basic chemicals  that comprise the first industry group from the production of intermediate and end products produced by further  processing of basic chemicals that make up the remaining industry groups.   This subsector does not include all industries transforming raw materials by a chemical process. It is common for  some chemical processing to occur during mining operations. These beneficiating operations, such as copper  concentrating, are classified in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction. Furthermore, the refining  of crude petroleum is included in Subsector 324, Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing. In addition, the  manufacturing of aluminum oxide is included in Subsector 331, Primary Metal Manufacturing; and beverage  distilleries are classified in Subsector 312, Beverage and Tobacco Product Manufacturing. As is the case of these  two activities, the grouping of industries into subsectors may take into account the association of the activities  performed with other activities in the subsector.

Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing," The Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing subsector is based on the transformation of mined or quarried  nonmetallic minerals, such as sand, gravel, stone, clay, and refractory materials, into products for intermediate or  final consumption. Processes used include grinding, mixing, cutting, shaping, and honing. Heat often is used in the  process and chemicals are frequently mixed to change the composition, purity, and chemical properties for the  intended product. For example, glass is produced by heating silica sand to the melting point (sometimes combined  with cullet or recycled glass) and then drawn, floated, or blow molded to the desired shape or thickness. Refractory  materials are heated and then formed into bricks or other shapes for use in industrial applications.   The Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing subsector includes establishments that manufacture bricks,  refractories, ceramic products, and glass and glass products, such as plate glass and containers. Also included are  cement and concrete products, lime, gypsum, and other nonmetallic mineral products including abrasive products,  ceramic plumbing fixtures, statuary, cut stone products, and mineral wool. The products are used in a wide range of  activities from construction and heavy and light manufacturing to articles for personal use.   Mining, beneficiating, and manufacturing activities often occur in a single location. Separate receipts will be  collected for these activities whenever possible. When receipts cannot be broken out between mining and  manufacturing, establishments that mine or quarry nonmetallic minerals, beneficiate the nonmetallic minerals, and  further process the nonmetallic minerals into a more finished manufactured product are classified based on the  primary activity of the establishment. A mine that manufactures a small amount of finished products is classified in  Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction. An establishment that mines whose primary output is a  more finished manufactured product is classified in the Manufacturing sector.   Excluded from the Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing subsector are establishments that primarily  beneficiate mined nonmetallic minerals. Beneficiation is the process whereby the extracted material is reduced to  particles that can be separated into mineral and waste, the former suitable for further processing or direct use.  Beneficiation establishments are included in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction. "

Primary Metal Manufacturing," Industries in the Primary Metal Manufacturing subsector smelt and/or refine ferrous and nonferrous metals from  ore, pig, or scrap, using electrometallurgical and other process metallurgical techniques. Establishments in this  subsector also manufacture metal alloys and superalloys by introducing other chemical elements to pure metals. The  output of smelting and refining, usually in ingot form, is used in rolling, drawing, and extruding operations to make  sheet, strip, bar, rod, or wire, and in molten form to make castings and other basic metal products.   Primary manufacturing of ferrous and nonferrous metals begins with ore or concentrate as the primary input.  Establishments manufacturing primary metals from ore and/or concentrate remain classified in the primary smelting,  primary refining, or iron and steel mill industries regardless of the form of their output. Establishments primarily  engaged in secondary smelting and/or secondary refining recover ferrous and nonferrous metals from scrap and/or  dross. The output of the secondary smelting and/or secondary refining industries is limited to shapes such as ingot  or billet that will be further processed. Recovery of metals from scrap often occurs in establishments that are  primarily engaged in activities, such as rolling, drawing, extruding, or similar processes.   Excluded from the Primary Metal Manufacturing subsector are establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing  ferrous and nonferrous forgings (except ferrous forgings made in steel mills) and stampings. Although forging,  stamping, and casting are all methods used to make metal shapes, forging and stamping do not use molten metals  and are included in Subsector 332, Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing.

Machinery Manufacturing," Industries in the Machinery Manufacturing subsector create end products that apply mechanical force, for  example, the application of gears and levers, to perform work. Some important processes for the manufacture of  machinery are forging, stamping, bending, forming, and machining that are used to shape individual pieces of metal.  Processes, such as welding and assembling are used to join separate parts together. Although these processes are  similar to those used in metal fabricating establishments, machinery manufacturing is different because it typically  TÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ employs multiple metal forming processes in manufacturing the various parts of the machine. Moreover, complex  assembly operations are an inherent part of the production process.   In general, design considerations are very important in machinery production. Establishments specialize in  making machinery designed for particular applications. Thus, design is considered to be part of the production  process for the purpose of implementing NAICS. The NAICS structure reflects this by defining industries and  industry groups that make machinery for different applications. A broad distinction exists between machinery that is  generally used in a variety of industrial applications (i.e., general purpose machinery) and machinery that is  designed to be used in a particular industry (i.e., special purpose machinery). Three industry groups consist of  special purpose machinery--Agriculture, Construction, and Mining Machinery Manufacturing; Industrial Machinery  Manufacturing; and Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing. The other industry groups make  general purpose machinery: Ventilation, Heating, Air-Conditioning, and Commercial Refrigeration Equipment  Manufacturing; Metalworking Machinery Manufacturing; Engine, Turbine, and Power Transmission Equipment  Manufacturing; and Other General Purpose Machinery Manufacturing.  3331 Agriculture, Construction, and Mining Machinery Manufacturing  This industry group comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing one or more of the following:  (1) farm machinery and equipment, power mowing equipment, and other powered home lawn and garden  equipment; (2) construction machinery, surface mining machinery, and logging equipment; and (3) oil and gas field  and underground mining machinery and equipment.

Furniture and Related Product Manufacturing," Industries in the Furniture and Related Product Manufacturing subsector make furniture and related articles, such  as mattresses, window blinds, cabinets, and fixtures. The processes used in the manufacture of furniture include the  cutting, bending, molding, laminating, and assembly of such materials as wood, metal, glass, plastics, and rattan.  However, the production process for furniture is not solely bending metal, cutting and shaping wood, or extruding  and molding plastics. Design and fashion trends play an important part in the production of furniture. The  integrated design of the article for both esthetic and functional qualities is also a major part of the process of  manufacturing furniture. Design services may be performed by the furniture establishment's work force or may be  purchased from industrial designers.   Furniture may be made of any material, but the most common ones used in North America are metal and wood.  Furniture manufacturing establishments may specialize in making articles primarily from one material. Some of the  equipment required to make a wooden table, for example, is different from that used to make a metal one. However,  furniture is usually made from several materials. A wooden table might have metal brackets, and a wooden chair a  fabric or plastics seat. Therefore, in NAICS, furniture initially is classified based on the type of furniture  (application for which it is designed) rather than the material used. For example, an upholstered sofa is treated as  household furniture, although it may also be used in hotels or offices.   When classifying furniture according to the component material from which it is made, furniture made from more  than one material is classified based on the material used in the frame, or if there is no frame, the predominant  component material. Upholstered household furniture (excluding kitchen and dining room chairs with upholstered  seats) is classified without regard to the frame material. Kitchen or dining room chairs with upholstered seats are  classified according to the frame material.   Furniture may be made on a stock or custom basis and may be shipped assembled or unassembled (i.e.,  knockdown). The manufacture of furniture parts and frames is included in this subsector.   Some of the processes used in furniture manufacturing are similar to processes that are used in other segments of  manufacturing. For example, cutting and assembly occurs in the production of wood trusses that are classified in  Subsector 321, Wood Product Manufacturing. However, the multiple processes that distinguish wood furniture  manufacturing from wood product manufacturing warrant inclusion of wooden furniture manufacturing in the  Furniture and Related Product Manufacturing subsector. Metal furniture manufacturing uses techniques that are also  employed in the manufacturing of roll formed products classified in Subsector 332, Fabricated Metal Product  Manufacturing. The molding process for plastics furniture is similar to the molding of other plastics products.  However, plastics furniture producing establishments tend to specialize in furniture.

Miscellaneous Manufacturing," Industries in the Miscellaneous Manufacturing subsector make a wide range of products that cannot readily be  classified in specific NAICS subsectors in manufacturing. Processes used by these establishments vary  significantly, both among and within industries. For example, a variety of manufacturing processes are used in  manufacturing sporting and athletic goods that include products such as tennis rackets and golf balls. The processes  for these products differ from each other, and the processes differ significantly from the fabrication processes used  in making dolls or toys, the melting and shaping of precious metals to make jewelry, and the bending, forming, and  assembly used in making medical products.   The industries in this subsector are defined by what is made rather than how it is made. Although individual  establishments might be appropriately classified elsewhere in the NAICS structure, for historical continuity, these  product-based industries were maintained. In most cases, no one process or material predominates for an industry.   Establishments in this subsector manufacture products as diverse as medical equipment and supplies, jewelry,  sporting goods, toys, and office supplies. "

"
Wholesale Trade,"The Sector as a Whole   The Wholesale Trade sector comprises establishments engaged in wholesaling merchandise, generally without  transformation, and rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise. The merchandise described in this  sector includes the outputs of agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and certain information industries, such as  publishing.   The wholesaling process is an intermediate step in the distribution of merchandise. Wholesalers are organized to  sell or arrange the purchase or sale of (a) goods for resale (i.e., goods sold to other wholesalers or retailers), (b)  capital or durable nonconsumer goods, and (c) raw and intermediate materials and supplies used in production.   Wholesalers sell merchandise to other businesses and normally operate from a warehouse or office. These  warehouses and offices are characterized by having little or no display of merchandise. In addition, neither the  design nor the location of the premises is intended to solicit walk-in traffic. Wholesalers do not normally use  advertising directed to the general public. Customers are generally reached initially via telephone, in-person  marketing, or by specialized advertising that may include Internet and other electronic means. Follow-up orders are  either vendor-initiated or client-initiated, generally based on previous sales, and typically exhibit strong ties between  sellers and buyers. In fact, transactions are often conducted between wholesalers and clients that have long-standing  business relationships.   This sector comprises two main types of wholesalers: merchant wholesalers that sell goods on their own account  and agents and brokers that arrange sales and purchases for others generally for a commission or fee.   (1) Establishments that sell goods on their own account are known as wholesale merchants, distributors, jobbers,  drop shippers, and import/export merchants. Also included as wholesale merchants are sales offices and sales  branches (but not retail stores) maintained by manufacturing, refining, or mining enterprises apart from their plants  or mines for the purpose of marketing their products, and group purchasing organizations primarily purchasing and  selling goods on their own account. Merchant wholesale establishments typically maintain their own warehouse,  where they receive and handle goods for their customers. Goods are generally sold without transformation, but may  include integral functions, such as sorting, packaging, labeling, and other marketing services.   (2) Establishments arranging for the purchase or sale of goods owned by others or purchasing goods, generally on  a commission basis are known as business-to-business electronic markets, agents and brokers, commission  merchants, import/export agents and brokers, auction companies, group purchasing organizations (acting as agents),  and manufacturers' representatives. These establishments operate from offices and generally do not own or handle  the goods they sell.   Some wholesale establishments may be connected with a single manufacturer and promote and sell the particular  manufacturer's products to a wide range of other wholesalers or retailers. Other wholesalers may be connected to a  retail chain, or limited number of retail chains, and only provide a variety of products needed by that particular retail  operation(s). These wholesalers may obtain the products from a wide range of manufacturers. Still other  wholesalers may not take title to the goods, but act as agents and brokers for a commission.   Although, in general, wholesaling normally denotes sales in large volumes, durable nonconsumer goods may be  sold in single units. Sales of capital or durable nonconsumer goods used in the production of goods and services,  such as farm machinery, medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and industrial machinery, are always included in  wholesale trade. "
"Merchant Wholesalers, Durable Goods"," Industries in the Merchant Wholesalers, Durable Goods subsector sell capital or durable goods to other businesses.

Retail Trade,"The Retail Trade sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in retailing merchandise, generally without transformation, and rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise.
The retailing process is the final step in the distribution of merchandise; retailers are, therefore, organized to sell merchandise in small quantities to the general public. Retail stores are fixed point-of-sale locations, located and designed to attract a high volume of walk-in customers. In general, retail stores have extensive displays of merchandise and use mass-media advertising to attract customers. Retailers often reach customers and market merchandise with methods other than, or in addition to, physical stores, such as Internet websites, the broadcasting of ""infomercials,"" the broadcasting and publishing of direct-response advertising, the publishing of paper and electronic catalogs, door-to-door solicitation, in-home demonstration, selling from portable stalls (street vendors, except food), and distribution through vending machines. Establishments engaged in the direct sale and home delivery of products, such as home heating oil dealers and home delivery newspaper routes, are included here.
Retail establishments typically sell merchandise to the general public for personal or household consumption, but some also serve business and institutional clients. These include office supply retailers, computer and software retailers, building materials dealers, plumbing supply retailers, and electrical supply retailers."
Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers,"The Sector as a Whole   The Retail Trade sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in retailing merchandise, generally without  transformation, and rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise.   The retailing process is the final step in the distribution of merchandise; retailers are, therefore, organized to sell  merchandise in small quantities to the general public. Retail stores are fixed point-of-sale locations, located and  designed to attract a high volume of walk-in customers. In general, retail stores have extensive displays of  merchandise and use mass-media advertising to attract customers. Retailers often reach customers and market  merchandise with methods other than, or in addition to, physical stores, such as Internet websites, the broadcasting  of ""infomercials,"" the broadcasting and publishing of direct-response advertising, the publishing of paper and  electronic catalogs, door-to-door solicitation, in-home demonstration, selling from portable stalls (street vendors,  except food), and distribution through vending machines. Establishments engaged in the direct sale and home  delivery of products, such as home heating oil dealers and home delivery newspaper routes, are included here.   Retail establishments typically sell merchandise to the general public for personal or household consumption, but  some also serve business and institutional clients. These include office supply retailers, computer and software  retailers, building materials dealers, plumbing supply retailers, and electrical supply retailers.   In addition to retailing merchandise, some retailers are also engaged in the provision of after-sales services, such  as repair and installation. For example, new automobile dealers, electronics and appliance retailers, and musical  instrument and supplies retailers often provide repair services. As a general rule, establishments engaged in retailing  merchandise and providing after-sales services are classified in this sector.   Retail trade establishments are grouped into industries and industry groups typically based on one or more of the  following criteria:   (a) The merchandise line or lines carried; for example, specialty retailers are distinguished from general-line  retailers.   (b) The usual trade designation of the establishments. This criterion applies in cases where a retailer is well  recognized by the industry and the public, but difficult to define strictly in terms of merchandise lines carried; for  example, pharmacies and department stores.   (c) Human resource requirements in terms of expertise; for example, the staff of an automobile dealer requires  knowledge in financing, registering, and licensing issues that are not necessary in other retail industries.   The buying of goods for resale is a characteristic of retail trade establishments that particularly distinguishes them  from establishments in the agriculture, manufacturing, and construction industries. For example, farms that sell their  products at or from the point of production are not classified in retail, but rather in agriculture. Similarly,  establishments that both manufacture and sell their products to the general public are not classified in retail, but  rather in manufacturing. However, establishments that engage in processing activities incidental to retailing are  classified in retail. This includes optical goods retailers that grind lenses, and meat and seafood retailers that process  carcasses into cuts.   Wholesalers also engage in the buying of goods for resale, but they are not usually organized to serve the general  public. They typically operate from a warehouse or office, and neither the design nor the location of these premises  is intended to solicit a high volume of walk-in traffic. Wholesalers supply institutional, industrial, wholesale, and  retail clients; their operations are, therefore, generally organized to purchase, sell, and deliver merchandise in larger  quantities. However, dealers of durable nonconsumer goods, such as farm machinery and heavy-duty trucks, are  included in wholesale trade even if they often sell these products in single units. "

Transportation and Warehousing,"The Sector as a Whole   The Transportation and Warehousing sector includes industries providing transportation of passengers and cargo,  warehousing and storage for goods, scenic and sightseeing transportation, and support activities related to modes of  transportation. Establishments in these industries use transportation equipment or transportation-related facilities as  a productive asset. The type of equipment depends on the mode of transportation. The modes of transportation are  air, rail, water, road, and pipeline.   The Transportation and Warehousing sector distinguishes three basic types of activities: subsectors for each mode  of transportation, a subsector for warehousing and storage, and a subsector for establishments providing support  activities for transportation. In addition, there are subsectors for establishments that provide passenger  transportation for scenic and sightseeing purposes, postal services, and courier services.   A separate subsector for support activities is established in the sector because, first, support activities for  transportation are inherently multimodal, such as freight transportation arrangement, or have multimodal aspects.  Secondly, there are production process similarities among the support activity industries.   One of the support activities identified in the Support Activities for Transportation subsector is the routine repair  and maintenance of transportation equipment (e.g., aircraft at an airport, railroad rolling stock at a railroad terminal,  or ships at a harbor or port facility). Such establishments do not perform complete overhauling or rebuilding of  transportation equipment (i.e., periodic restoration of transportation equipment to original design specifications) or  transportation equipment conversion (i.e., major modification to systems). An establishment that primarily performs  factory (or shipyard) overhauls, rebuilding, or conversions of aircraft, railroad rolling stock, or ships is classified in  Subsector 336, Transportation Equipment Manufacturing, according to the type of equipment.   Many of the establishments in this sector often operate on networks, with physical facilities, labor forces, and  equipment spread over an extensive geographic area.   Warehousing establishments in this sector are distinguished from merchant wholesaling in that the warehouse  establishments do not sell the goods.   Excluded from this sector are establishments primarily engaged in providing travel agent, travel arrangement, and  reservation services that support transportation establishments, hotels, other businesses, and government agencies.  These establishments are classified in Sector 56, Administrative and Support and Waste Management and  Remediation Services. Establishments primarily engaged in providing rental and leasing of transportation  equipment without operator are classified in Subsector 532, Rental and Leasing Services. Establishments primarily  engaged in providing medical care with transportation are classified in Sector 62, Health Care and Social Assistance. "
Air Transportation," Industries in the Air Transportation subsector provide air transportation of passengers and/or cargo using aircraft,  such as airplanes, helicopters, and spacecraft. The subsector distinguishes scheduled from nonscheduled air  transportation. Scheduled air carriers fly regular routes on regular schedules and operate even if flights are only  partially loaded. Nonscheduled carriers often operate during nonpeak time slots at busy airports. These  establishments have more flexibility with respect to choice of airport, hours of operation, load factors, and similar  operational characteristics. Nonscheduled carriers provide chartered air transportation of passengers, cargo, or  specialty flying services. Specialty flying services establishments use general purpose aircraft to provide a variety  of specialized flying services.   Scenic and sightseeing air transportation and air courier services are not included in this subsector but are included  in Subsector 487, Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation, and in Subsector 492, Couriers and Messengers,  respectively. Although these activities may use aircraft, they are different from the activities included in air  transportation. Air sightseeing does not usually involve place-to-place transportation; the passenger's flight (e.g.,  balloon ride, aerial sightseeing) typically starts and ends at the same location. Courier services (individual package  or cargo delivery) include more than air transportation; road transportation is usually required to deliver the cargo to  the intended recipient. "

Truck Transportation," Industries in the Truck Transportation subsector provide over-the-road transportation of cargo using motor  vehicles, such as trucks and tractor trailers. The subsector is subdivided into general freight trucking and specialized  freight trucking. This distinction reflects differences in equipment used, type of load carried, scheduling, terminal,  and other networking services. General freight transportation establishments handle a wide variety of general  commodities, generally palletized, and transported in a container or van trailer. Specialized freight transportation is  TÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the transportation of cargo that, because of size, weight, shape, or other inherent characteristics, requires specialized  equipment for transportation.   Each of these industry groups is further subdivided based on distance traveled. Local trucking establishments  primarily carry goods within a single metropolitan area and its adjacent nonurban areas. Long-distance trucking  establishments carry goods between metropolitan areas.   The Specialized Freight Trucking industry group includes a separate industry for Used Household and Office  Goods Moving. The household and office goods movers are separated because of the substantial network of  establishments that has developed to deal with local and long-distance moving and the associated storage. In this  area, the same establishment provides both local and long-distance services, while other specialized freight  establishments generally limit their services to either local or long-distance hauling.

Postal Service," The Postal Service subsector includes the activities of the National Post Office and its subcontractors operating  under a universal service obligation to provide mail services, and using the infrastructure required to fulfill that  obligation. These services include delivering letters and small parcels. These articles can be described as those that  can be handled by one person without using special equipment. This allows the collection, pick-up, and delivery  operations to be done with limited labor costs and minimal equipment. Sorting and transportation activities, where  necessary, are generally mechanized. The restriction to small parcels distinguishes these establishments from those  in the transportation industries. These establishments may also provide express delivery services using the  infrastructure established for provision of basic mail services.   The traditional activity of the National Postal Service is described in this subsector. Subcontractors include rural  post offices on contract to the Postal Service.   Bulk transportation of mail on contract to the Postal Service is not included here, because it is usually done by  transportation establishments that carry other customers' cargo as well. Establishments that provide courier and  express delivery services without operating under a universal service obligation are classified in Subsector 492,  Couriers and Messengers. "

"
Information,"The Information sector comprises establishments engaged in the following processes: (a) producing and distributing information and cultural products, (b) providing the means to transmit or distribute these products as well as data or communications, and (c) processing data.
The main components of this sector are motion picture and sound recording industries; publishing industries, including software publishing; broadcasting and content providers; telecommunications industries; computing infrastructure providers, data processing, Web hosting, and related services; and Web search portals, libraries, archives, and other information services.
The unique characteristics of information and cultural products, and of the processes involved in their production and distribution, distinguish the Information sector from the goods-producing and service-producing sectors. Some of these characteristics are:
1. Unlike traditional goods, an ''information or cultural product,'' such as an online newspaper or a television program, does not necessarily have tangible qualities, nor is it necessarily associated with a particular form. A movie can be viewed at a movie theater or through television broadcast, video-on-demand, or streaming services. A sound recording can be aired on radio, embedded in multimedia products, streamed, or sold at a record store.
2. Unlike traditional services, the delivery of these products does not require direct contact between the supplier and the consumer.
3. The value of these products to the consumer lies in their informational, educational, cultural, or entertainment content, not in the format in which they are distributed. Most of these products are protected from unlawful reproduction by copyright laws.
4. The intangible property aspect of information and cultural products makes the processes involved in their production and distribution very different from goods and services. Only those possessing the rights to these works are authorized to reproduce, alter, improve, and distribute them. Acquiring and using these rights often involves significant costs. In addition, technology has revolutionized the distribution of these products. It is possible to distribute them in a physical form, via broadcast, or online.
5. Distributors of information and cultural products can easily add value to the products they distribute. For instance, broadcasters add advertising not contained in the original product. This capacity means that unlike traditional goods distributors, they derive revenue not from sale of the distributed product to the final consumer, but from those who pay for the privilege of adding information to the original product. Similarly, a directory and mailing list publisher can acquire the rights to thousands of previously published newspaper and periodical articles and add new value by providing search and software and organizing the information in a way that facilitates research and retrieval. These products often command a much higher price than the original information.
Excluded from this sector are establishments primarily engaged in custom design of software; mass reproducing software or other prerecorded audio and video material on magnetic or optical media; producing live artistic and cultural works or productions; and performing in or creating artistic and cultural works or productions as independent (i.e., freelance) individuals."
Motion Picture and Sound Recording Industries," Industries in the Motion Picture and Sound Recording Industries subsector group establishments involved in the  production and distribution of motion pictures and sound recordings. While producers and distributors of motion  pictures and sound recordings issue works for sale as traditional publishers do, the processes are sufficiently  different to warrant placing establishments engaged in these activities in a separate subsector. Production is  typically a complex process that involves several distinct types of establishments that are engaged in activities, such  as contracting with performers, creating the film or sound content, and providing technical postproduction services.  Film distribution is often to exhibitors, such as theaters and broadcasters, rather than through the wholesale and  TÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ retail distribution chain. When the product is in a mass-produced form, NAICS treats production and distribution as  the major economic activity as it does in the Publishing Industries subsector, rather than as a subsidiary activity to  the manufacture of such products.   This subsector does not include establishments primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution of video and sound  recordings, such as compact discs and audio tapes; these establishments are included in the Wholesale Trade sector.  Reproduction of video and sound recordings that is carried out separately from establishments engaged in  production and distribution is treated in NAICS as a manufacturing activity. Establishments that primarily acquire  the rights to distribute video and sound recordings to the public via television or radio broadcast or streaming  distribution services are classified in Subsector 516, Broadcasting and Content Providers. Establishments using  facilities and infrastructure that they operate to distribute cable and satellite television subscription programming are  included in Subsector 517, Telecommunications. "

"
Retail Trade,"The Retail Trade sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in retailing merchandise, generally without transformation, and rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise.
The retailing process is the final step in the distribution of merchandise; retailers are, therefore, organized to sell merchandise in small quantities to the general public. Retail stores are fixed point-of-sale locations, located and designed to attract a high volume of walk-in customers. In general, retail stores have extensive displays of merchandise and use mass-media advertising to attract customers. Retailers often reach customers and market merchandise with methods other than, or in addition to, physical stores, such as Internet websites, the broadcasting of ""infomercials,"" the broadcasting and publishing of direct-response advertising, the publishing of paper and electronic catalogs, door-to-door solicitation, in-home demonstration, selling from portable stalls (street vendors, except food), and distribution through vending machines. Establishments engaged in the direct sale and home delivery of products, such as home heating oil dealers and home delivery newspaper routes, are included here.
Retail establishments typically sell merchandise to the general public for personal or household consumption, but some also serve business and institutional clients. These include office supply retailers, computer and software retailers, building materials dealers, plumbing supply retailers, and electrical supply retailers.
In addition to retailing merchandise, some retailers are also engaged in the provision of after-sales services, such as repair and installation. For example, new automobile dealers, electronics and appliance retailers, and musical instrument and supplies retailers often provide repair services. As a general rule, establishments engaged in retailing merchandise and providing after-sales services are classified in this sector.
Retail trade establishments are grouped into industries and industry groups typically based on one or more of the following criteria:"
Broadcasting and Content Providers,"Industries in the Broadcasting and Content Providers subsector include establishments that create content or acquire the right to distribute content and subsequently broadcast or distribute that content. The industry groups (Radio and Television Broadcasting Stations and Media Streaming Distribution Services, Social Networks, and Other Media Networks and Content Providers) are based on differences in the methods of communication and the nature of services provided. The Radio and Television Broadcasting Stations industry group includes establishments that operate radio or television broadcasting stations for the programming and transmission of programs to the public. Programming may originate in their own studio, from an affiliated network, or from external sources. The Media Streaming Distribution Services, Social Networks, and Other Media Networks and Content Providers industry group includes establishments providing media streaming distribution services, operating social network sites, operating media broadcasting and cable television networks, and supplying information, such as news reports, articles, pictures, and features, to the news media. The establishments classified in this subsector are often engaged in the production and purchase of programs and other textual, audio, and/or video content, and they typically generate revenues from the sale of advertising space and air time, subscriptions, donations, subsidies, and/or the sale of programs."
Motion Picture and Sound Recording Industries," Industries in the Motion Picture and Sound Recording Industries subsector group establishments involved in the  production and distribution of motion pictures and sound recordings. While producers and distributors of motion  pictures and sound recordings issue works for sale as traditional publishers do, the processes are sufficiently  different to warrant placing establishments engaged in these activities in a separate subsector. Production is  typically a complex process that involves several distinct types of establishments that are engaged in activities, such  as contracting with performers, creating the film or sound content, and providing technical postproduction services.  Film distribution is often to exhibitors, such as theaters and broadcasters, rather than through the wholesale and  TÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ retail distribution chain. When the product is in a mass-produced form, NAICS treats production and distribution as  the major economic activity as it does in the Publishing Industries subsector, rather than as a subsidiary activity to  the manufacture of such products.   This subsector does not include establishments primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution of video and sound  recordings, such as compact discs and audio tapes; these establishments are included in the Wholesale Trade sector.  Reproduction of video and sound recordings that is carried out separately from establishments engaged in  production and distribution is treated in NAICS as a manufacturing activity. Establishments that primarily acquire  the rights to distribute video and sound recordings to the public via television or radio broadcast or streaming  distribution services are classified in Subsector 516, Broadcasting and Content Providers. Establishments using  facilities and infrastructure that they operate to distribute cable and satellite television subscription programming are  included in Subsector 517, Telecommunications. "

Establishments in this industry do not operate as telecommunications carriers."
Finance and Insurance,"The Finance and Insurance sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in financial transactions (transactions involving the creation, liquidation, or change in ownership of financial assets) and/or in facilitating financial transactions. Three principal types of activities are identified:
1. Raising funds by taking deposits and/or issuing securities and, in the process, incurring liabilities. Establishments engaged in this activity use raised funds to acquire financial assets by making loans and/or purchasing securities. Putting themselves at risk, they channel funds from lenders to borrowers and transform or repackage the funds with respect to maturity, scale, and risk. This activity is known as financial intermediation.
2. Pooling of risk by underwriting insurance and annuities. Establishments engaged in this activity collect fees, insurance premiums, or annuity considerations; build up reserves; invest those reserves; and make contractual payments. Fees are based on the expected incidence of the insured risk and the expected return on investment.
3. Providing specialized services facilitating or supporting financial intermediation, insurance, and employee benefit programs.
In addition, monetary authorities charged with monetary control are included in this sector.
The subsectors, industry groups, and industries within the Finance and Insurance sector are defined on the basis of their unique production processes. As with all industries, the production processes are distinguished by their use of specialized human resources and specialized physical capital. In addition, the way in which these establishments acquire and allocate financial capital, their source of funds, and the use of those funds provides a third basis for distinguishing characteristics of the production process. For instance, the production process in raising funds through deposit-taking is different from the process of raising funds in bond or money markets. The process of making loans to individuals also requires different production processes than does the creation of investment pools or the underwriting of securities.
Most of the Finance and Insurance subsectors contain one or more industry groups of (1) intermediaries with similar patterns of raising and using funds and (2) establishments engaged in activities that facilitate, or are otherwise related to, that type of financial or insurance intermediation. Industries within this sector are defined in terms of activities for which a production process can be specified, and many of these activities are not exclusive to a particular type of financial institution. To deal with the varied activities taking place within existing financial institutions, the approach is to split these institutions into components performing specialized services. This requires defining the units engaged in providing those services and developing procedures that allow for their delineation. These units are the equivalents for finance and insurance of the establishments defined for other industries.
The output of many financial services, as well as the inputs and the processes by which they are combined, cannot be observed at a single location and can only be defined at a higher level of the organizational structure of the enterprise. Additionally, a number of independent activities that represent separate and distinct production processes may take place at a single location belonging to a multilocation financial firm. Activities are more likely to be homogeneous with respect to production characteristics than are locations, at least in financial services. The classification defines activities broadly enough that it can be used both by those classifying by location and by those employing a more top-down approach to the delineation of the establishment.
Establishments engaged in activities that facilitate, or are otherwise related to, the various types of intermediation are included in multiple subsectors, rather than in a separate subsector dedicated to services alone, because these services are performed by intermediaries, as well as by specialist establishments, and the extent to which the activity of the intermediaries can be separately identified is not clear.
Financial industries are extensive users of electronic means for facilitating the verification of financial balances, authorizing transactions, transferring funds to and from transactors' accounts, notifying banks (or credit card issuers) of the individual transactions, and providing daily summaries. Since these transaction processing activities are integral to the production of finance and insurance services, establishments that principally provide a financial transaction processing service are classified in this sector, rather than in the data processing industry in the Information sector."

This sector also includes establishments primarily engaged in managing real estate for others, selling, renting, and/or buying real estate for others, and appraising real estate. These activities are closely related to this sector's main activity, and from a production basis they are included here.

Establishments renting or leasing equipment with operators are classified in various subsectors of NAICS depending on the nature of the services provided (e.g., transportation, construction, agriculture). These activities are excluded from this sector because the client is paying for the expertise and knowledge of the equipment operator, in addition to the rental of the equipment.

Excluded from this subsector are establishments primarily engaged in publishing educational software or other  educational materials without providing instruction. These establishments are classified in Subsector 513,  Publishing Industries.

Public Administration,"The Public Administration sector consists of establishments of federal, state, and local government agencies that administer, oversee, and manage public programs and have executive, legislative, or judicial authority over other institutions within a given area. These agencies also set policy, create laws, adjudicate civil and criminal legal cases, and provide for public safety and for national defense. In general, government establishments in the Public Administration sector oversee governmental programs and activities that are not performed by private establishments. Establishments in this sector typically are engaged in the organization and financing of the production of public goods and services, most of which are provided for free or at prices that are not economically significant.
Government establishments also engage in a wide range of productive activities covering not only public goods and services but also individual goods and services similar to those produced in sectors typically identified with private-sector establishments. In general, ownership is not a criterion for classification in NAICS. Therefore, government establishments engaged in the production of private-sector-like goods and services should be classified in the same industry as private-sector establishments engaged in similar activities.
As a practical matter, it is difficult to identify separate establishment detail for many government agencies. To the extent that separate establishment records are available, the administration of governmental programs is classified in Sector 92, Public Administration, while the operation of governmental programs is classified elsewhere in NAICS based on the activities performed. For example, the governmental administrative authority for an airport is classified in Industry 92612, Regulation and Administration of Transportation Programs, while operating the airport is classified in Industry 48811, Airport Operations. When separate records for multi-establishment companies are not available to distinguish between the administration of a governmental program and the operation of it, the establishment is classified in Sector 92, Public Administration.
Examples of government-provided goods and services that are classified in sectors other than Public Administration include: schools, classified in Sector 61, Educational Services; health care facilities, classified in Sector 62, Health Care and Social Assistance; establishments operating transportation facilities, classified in Sector 48-49, Transportation and Warehousing; the operation of utilities, classified in Sector 22, Utilities; and the Government Printing Office, classified in Subsector 323, Printing and Related Support Activities."
